Monitor knee discomfort and adjust as necessary.\n- **Flexibility**: Incorporate knee-specific stretches to improve mobility and reduce discomfort.\n- **Deload Weeks**: Week 11 serves as a deload week, reducing overall volume to allow recovery before the final push.\n- **Recovery**: Emphasize recovery strategies, including adequate hydration, nutrition, and sleep.\n\n---\n\n### Expected Outcomes and Milestones\n- **Milestone Checkpoints**:\n  - **End of Week 4**: Assess running comfort at 5km; adjust training if knee pain persists.\n  - **End of Week 8**: Evaluate strength gains and running endurance; aim for 8km run.\n  - **End of Week 10**: Complete a 10km run; assess readiness for the goal.\n  - **End of Week 12**: Recovery assessment; plan next steps based on progress.\n\n- **Expected Outcomes**:\n  - Improved running endurance and comfort, especially with knee management.\n  - Increased strength across major muscle groups.\n  - Enhanced flexibility and mobility, particularly in the lower body.\n\nThis structured plan aligns with the user's goals, experience level, and timeline, ensuring a safe and effective approach to achieving the desired outcomes.",
